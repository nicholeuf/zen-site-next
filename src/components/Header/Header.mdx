## Header — composition and stories

This page documents how the Header is built from a few smaller components and how you can preview each part individually in Storybook.

We compose the header from these story modules:

- `Header` (the assembled app bar)
- `HeaderLogo` (the logo used inside the app bar)
- `NavigationItem` (desktop navigation link)
- `MobileNavigationItem` (mobile navigation link)

The pattern used here follows the Storybook docs for "Working with multiple components":
https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-docs/mdx#working-with-multiple-components

### Assembled header

A preview of the assembled header. This uses the main story exported from `Header.stories.tsx`.

<Canvas of={HeaderStories.Playground} parameters={{ layout: 'fullscreen' }} />

If the assembled header doesn't render at mobile size in this docs canvas, open the standalone Mobile story to view the mobile viewport and controls:

[Go to Mobile Story](?path=/story/components-header-header--mobile)

### Logo

The `HeaderLogo` story shows the logo configuration and is rendered inside the app bar using a decorator so you can see it in-context.

<Canvas of={HeaderLogoStories.Playground} />

{/* Args table is not exported in this project's docs blocks; use the Controls panel in Storybook to inspect props. */}

### Navigation item (desktop)

Individual navigation items can be rendered and tested independently. Here is the default playground for `NavigationItem`.

<Canvas of={NavigationItemStories.Playground} />

{/* Use the Controls panel in Storybook to inspect NavigationItem props. */}

### Navigation item (mobile)

Mobile navigation items are the same principle but rendered for mobile contexts. Use the playground below to inspect props and interactions.

<Canvas of={MobileNavigationItemStories.Playground} />

{/* Use the Controls panel in Storybook to inspect MobileNavigationItem props. */}

### Notes

- Each of the component stories uses decorators to render the component in the appropriate parent (for example `HeaderAppBar` for the logo). That keeps the component stories focused on a single unit while showing it in-context.
- To reference a specific story export from another stories file, import the module as a namespace (for example `import * as HeaderLogoStories from './HeaderLogo.stories'`) and then use `<Story of={HeaderLogoStories.Playground} />` in MDX.
