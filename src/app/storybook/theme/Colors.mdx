# Colors

Documentation of the theme color palette used across the application. The
`Palette` story renders a set of swatches including MUI theme tokens and
project-specific constants so you can preview the colors and their hex values.

## Palette

<Canvas of={ColorsStories.Palette} />

## Usage

Use these tokens as the single source of truth for colors in the app. Prefer
theme tokens (for example `theme.palette.primary.main`) over hard-coded hex
values so components automatically pick up theme-level adjustments.

Note: this project does not use a dark mode variant — the palette is
designed for the light theme. When choosing or adjusting colors, ensure they
provide sufficient contrast in the light theme rather than relying on a
dark-mode fallback.

- Buttons and primary actions: `theme.palette.primary.main`
- Secondary accents and subtle calls-to-action: `theme.palette.secondary.main`
- Backgrounds: `theme.palette.background.default` / `theme.palette.background.paper`
- Text: `theme.palette.text.primary` / `theme.palette.text.secondary`
- Project-specific constants (see `constants.colors`) may be used for
  decorative elements, but prefer palette tokens for interactive UI elements.

### Example

When styling with the `sx` prop or `styled()` helper, reference theme tokens:

```tsx
// preferred — responds to theme mode
<Box sx={{ backgroundColor: (theme) => theme.palette.primary.main }} />

// avoid — harder to update globally
<Box sx={{ backgroundColor: '#5aa897' }} />
```

## Accessibility

Color is one cue among many. Keep the following accessibility considerations in
mind when applying palette colors:

- Contrast: Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background. Aim for
  at least 4.5:1 for body text and 3:1 for large text. Use `theme.palette.getContrastText` or a contrast checker during design.
- Do not rely on color alone to convey status (errors, success, warnings). Add
  icons, labels, or patterns to communicate meaning.
- Focus and hover states: Interactive elements should show clear focus and
  hover indicators that don't rely solely on color changes (outline, underline,
  or elevation changes are recommended).
  -- Test in light (project default) and, if you ever add a dark theme, dark
  modes: some colors that pass contrast in one mode may fail in the other;
  prefer palette tokens which adapt automatically.
- Provide text alternatives for color-only charts or decorative color maps.
